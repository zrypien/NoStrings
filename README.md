# NoStrings
Connections application that allows users to create, view, and RSVP to events. In the base build of this application, a pseudo music company is used.

Make sure to install all dependencies. MongoDB is used for the database, and other modules such as express and Morgan are needed. 

Files included are base connections and user logins that can be used to make the application functional from the getgo. They are not required, but without being used the connections being used on the app will fail to work. They must be deleted if that is the case.
